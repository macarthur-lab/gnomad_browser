                    <h4 class="media-heading">I have identified a rare variant in gnomAD that I believe is associated with a specific clinical phenotype. What phenotype data are available for these individuals?</h4>
                    Most of the individuals who have contributed data to gnomAD were not fully consented for phenotype data sharing, and unfortunately at this time we are typically unable to provide any information about the clinical status of variant carriers. We have made every effort to exclude individuals with severe pediatric diseases from the gnomAD data set, and certainly do not expect our data set to be <i>enriched</i> for such individuals, but we typically cannot rule out the possibility that some of our participants do actually suffer from your disease of interest.

                    <h4 class="media-heading">Can I get access to individual-level genotype data from gnomAD?</h4>
                    Many of the samples in gnomAD have individual-level sequencing data deposited in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap">dbGaP</a>, and these can be accessed by <a href="https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login">applying through that repository</a>. However, many other samples come from unpublished cohorts or from samples not in dbGaP. There is not currently any mechanism to systematically obtain individual-level genotype data from the database as a whole. Making this possible would require a truly staggering amount of paperwork, and we'd rather spend that time generating larger data sets for the community to use.

                    There are no restrictions or embargoes on the publication of results derived from the gnomAD database. However, we encourage people to <a href="mailto:exomeconsortium@gmail.com">check with the consortium</a> before embarking on large-scale analyses, to see if we already have something currently underway that overlaps with your plans; generally, we prefer to collaborate with users rather than compete with them.

                    <h4 class="media-heading">Why does the browser seem to disagree with the gnomAD VCF at this multiallelic site?</h4>
                    Due to the limitations of the VCF format, multi-allelic variants are put together on one VCF line.
                    This inevitably adds complexity to otherwise simple variants,
                    and thus when parsing onto the browser, we apply a <a href="http://www.cureffi.org/2014/04/24/converting-genetic-variants-to-their-minimal-representation/">minimal representation</a> script.
                    For instance, a variant whose REF is GC and ALT alleles are TC,G - the first ALT allele is actually a SNP and will be represented in the browser as G->T.

                    <h4 class="media-heading">Are all the individuals in the <a href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">Exome Variant Server</a> included?</h4>
                    No. We were not given permission from dbGaP to include individuals from several of the cohorts included in the NHLBI's Exome Sequencing Project. As a result, genuine rare variants that are present in the EVS may not be observed in gnomAD.

                    All of the "cancer" samples in the current release of ExAC are blood ("germline") samples from TCGA. We excluded any sample labeled as tumor. However, note that some sample/label swaps may have occurred in TCGA; in addition, it is possible that in some patients the blood samples are contaminated by circulating tumor cells.
